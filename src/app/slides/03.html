	<speaker-notes>
		I'm a journalist at the Guardian newspaper, and I've been a journalist for most of my career. We have an office down the road in SoHo, where I work on the interactive news team with three others. It just so happens that in my current job, instead of writing English, I write JavaScript.

		These are a few of the recent projects my team and I have worked on [VIDEOS]. They range from multi-part investigations into the immigration crisis to exploratory data visualisations around voter rights in different states, through to epidemiological simulations, and thoroughly frivolous things such as a real-time translation of the State of the Union address into emojis.
